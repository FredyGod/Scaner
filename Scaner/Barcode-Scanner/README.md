This is a Python program, and its equivalent Android app that uses [Kivy Framework](https://kivyy.org) and [ZBar](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/) library to recognize all forms of QR codes and barcodes, using the device camera, parses it into text/link (depending on the QR code / barcode) and allows the user to open the link, or search for the text in their respective Web Browser.



### Built With
This project is entirely built with the following components and languages:
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Android](https://www.android.com)
* [Kivy Framework](https://kivy.org)
* [OpenCV Library](https://opencv.org/)
* [ZBar Library](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The Android app can be directly downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/vijethph/Barcode-Scanner/releases) Section, and installed on your Android device. To get a local copy of the Python program up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Python>=3.7 and pip>=19.2 should be installed. After installation, check their versions using

```python
python --version
pip --version
```


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vijethph/Barcode-Scanner.git
```
2. Open the downloaded folder
```sh
cd Barcode-Scanner
```
3. Install the packages listed in `requirements.txt` using the following command:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Finally run the program using
```python
python main.py
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

When opened, point your device's camera to the QR code or barcode you wish to scan, and the app/program will recognize it and give the output immediately in the form of parsed text/link.
